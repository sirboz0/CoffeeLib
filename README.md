CoffeeLib

NOTE: CoffeeLib is still under development and has bugs and alot of missing features.

CoffeeLib is a free and open source 2d java game library that is made by sirbozo,
it is a new and really cool java game lib(maybe have some bugs and many missing features since its a new library)
hopefully the library will be complete in few days if not few weeks(lol)

IMPORTANT: library is developed and maintained by sirboz0(me) only so dev will be very slow and i am also busy working on other projects.
